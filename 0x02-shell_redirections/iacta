Oven Baked BBQ Beats The Grill Every Time
by Delish US

We all love good grilling recipes, especially grilled chicken, but we don't all have a grill, and sometimes we just don't want to stand outside, either (ya feel me?). And let's be honest, half the reason why we love BBQ chicken is because of the sauce right?

Luckily, this oven-baked barbecue chicken is just as wonderful and doesn't dry out with that beautiful layer of sauce on top. It's the perfect dinner, no matter the weather! Though a lot of folks opt for boneless and skinless, getting chicken bone-in and skin-on chicken adds extra flavor and texture to the dish. Bone-in typically takes longer to cook but you'll find that it is really worth it. If you only have boneless skinless though, it still works! Just pay attention to the chicken while cooking and pull it out a bit earlier if you need to.

The onions work double duty for this recipe. After roasting, they're extremely delicious, but they also add extra moisture to the pan and will prevent the sauce from burning and keep the chicken from drying out. We love this homemade bbq sauce because it's pretty easy to whip up, but if you are really short on time grab your favorite bottle of sauce and call it good! 

If you need a good side dish, can double down on the sweet-savory vibe and go for sweet potato fries or get your greens with some nice garlicky kale. Tried this recipe? Let us know in the comments and don't forget to rate it!
